# rock-paper-scissors-js
This project is the first pure JS project I've tried. The goal is to implement a simple rock, paper, scissors game in the console. This project is played using a UI, in a first attempt to create a webpage using Javascript.

I learned:
    1. how to use event listeners
    2. simple dom manipulation to make a dynamic site
    3. how to embed images on buttons
    4. JavaScript syntax

Currently there is a crude webpage HTML and CSS implemented just to show functionality. I plan on revisting this project to add some flair after I learn more advanced CSS.\
